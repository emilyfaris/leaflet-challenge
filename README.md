# leaflet-challenge: Earthquake and Tectonic Plates Visualization

## Project Overview
This project visualizes seismic activity around the world using data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) of earthquakes with magnitude 4.5 or greater from the last 30 days. Part one sets up a basic map visualizaion that displays the earthquake data. Part two extends the map functionality by integrating additional base layers and tectonic plate mapping.

### Features
- Dynamic earthquake markers whose radius is determined by the earthquake's magnitude.
- Interactive markers with popups displaying detailed information about the seismic event.
- Map legend showing the depth of the earthquakes.
- Tectonic plates plotted to show their boundaries.
- Multiple base maps (Satellite, Grayscale, and Humanitarian).
